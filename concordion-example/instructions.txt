h3. Exercise - concordion test fixture

Setup eclipse:
1. launch eclipse (jdk should be installed first)
   -choose some empty dir on your disk for the eclipse workspace
2. import concordion-example project to eclipse
   ->File->import->existing projects into eclipse->
     select the dir with unzipped concordion-example folder   
3. make sure it builds
   -there should be no build errors
   -configuration of the java for the build might be needed
     -select the project on the left hand
     -go to project properties via context menu (right click on the project)
     -configure the Java Build Path->Libraries, configure the JRE system library

Setup idea:
1. Open project in the IDEA (select the *.ipr)
2. Build it and make sure there are no build errors

Exercise:
1. Open 'specs/../GamblerBetting.html' - it's the Concordion specification file.
2. try to run 'specs/../GamblerBettingTest using junit
   -open the file
   -right click on the class name in the editor window->Run as->JUnit test
3. break the code, re-run and validate the test has failed
   -go to 'src/../CompletedGame.java'
   -modify 'calculateWin' method so that it returns an incorrect result
   -re-run the test (see #4)
4. fix back the code
5. open 'specs/../GamblerBetting.html' and implement the TODO scenarios
6. make sure the all scenarios pass

Extra exercises:

1. Use concordion's '#TEXT' variable:
  explode configureStakes() method into 3 separate setters
  use concordion:execute="setWinStake(#TEXT)" to configure the stakes.
